We provide a [web-based portal](https://github.com/casbin/web-ui) for model management and policy management:

![policy editor](https://hsluoyz.github.io/casbin/ui_policy_editor.png)

There are also 3rd-party admin portal projects that use Casbin as authorization engine. You can get started to build your own Casbin service based on these projects.
