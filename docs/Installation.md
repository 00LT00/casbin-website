  <artifactId>jcasbin</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

<!--Node.js-->
```
npm install casbin --save
```

<!--PHP-->
Require this package in the `composer.json` of your project. This will download the package:

```
composer require casbin/casbin
```

<!--Python-->
```
pip install casbin
```

<!--Delphi-->
Casbin4D comes in a package (currently for Delphi 10.3 Rio) and you can install it in the IDE. However, there are no visual components which means that you can use the units independently of packages. Just import the units in your project (assuming you do not mind the number of them).
