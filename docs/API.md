Casbin provides two sets of APIs to manage permissions:

- [Management API](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/management_api.go): the primitive API that provides full support for Casbin policy management. See [here](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/management_api_test.go) for examples.
- [RBAC API](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/rbac_api.go): a more friendly API for RBAC. This API is a subset of Management API. The RBAC users could use this API to simplify the code. See [here](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/rbac_api_test.go) for examples.
